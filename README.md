## 📈 ROI Calculator

### Cost Savings Formula
```
Annual Savings = (Downtime Hours Prevented × Hourly Downtime Cost) + 
                (IT Staff Hours Saved × Hourly Labor Cost) +
                (Infrastructure Optimization Savings)

Example: 
- 8 hours downtime prevented × $300,000/hour = $2,400,000
- 2,000 IT hours saved × $150/hour = $300,000  
- Infrastructure optimization = $500,000
- Total Annual Savings: $3,200,000
```
